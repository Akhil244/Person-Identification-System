Before Running the Project:

Create a dataset folder with two sub folders train and validatation and inside of that create the folder with person names and take good amount of images otherwise there will be a problem making a prediction 

install the dependencies 

then run:

python train_cnn_model.py

then:

python live_detection.py [webcam shows up ready for classifying the person in real time]
